# First Release

So it's about time I actually announced this release - After FlossUK Spring
Conference, I shipped the first release (version 0.001). So it's actually been
in the wild for over a month, and not a single issue! This might just be due to
people not knowing about it, although I must say I've only been using it on the
laptop I developed it on - This is mainly due to not fully pulling all my
configurations off from other devices.

Anyway! It is available now on CPAN, and can be seen on Metacpan here:
[App-Antigen on MetaCPAN](https://metacpan.org/release/App-Antigen). Enjoy!
