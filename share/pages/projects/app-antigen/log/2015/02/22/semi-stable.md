# Current Status

This App is actually fairly stable for its basic use case, and will work with
any github repository for holding a standardised Zsh Plugin. Before I actually
release this though, I need to document the way to use this app, and also to
document how to create plugins for it - Unlike other versions of Antigen, this
one does not support pulling plugins out of Oh-My-Zsh, and other large plugin
bundles.

Hopefully I will get to doing something with it soon...
