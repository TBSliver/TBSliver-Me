# Well that was close!

I almost managed to fail one of my new year promises within the first week!
Phew! Thankfully I have managed to sit down (just now) and start working on a
blog post. What, did you think I'd had a beer?

Speaking of beer, it has been a week! In that time I've had a party, two gaming
nights, and new years, and yet not a drop of alcohol has passed my lips! Even my
mouthwash is alcohol free... (Not on purpose, just hadnt noticed before). So
this is going well! only 3 and a bit weeks left to go before it is all over,
and I can enjoy some nice Belgian beers in Brussels, after the last day of
[FOSDEM][fosdem].

# What about the other plans?

So my other targets for this year are off to a great start! I started writing
some presentations today, after some various ideas from Matt and Mark at work.
I have managed to get hold of, and write an entirety of one page in my
page-a-day diary! So i'm only about 7 days behind...

  <div class="image-caption">My new Page-a-Day Diary</div>
</div>

Also, obviously this is my second blog post this year, so that was close. As for the
CPAN module, I am still working through the documentation so that it can be
used straight away by someone who didnt write the whole thing. I am hoping to
actually finish writing the documentation in the coming week, and then start
looking towards modifications I can do on it.

# What modifications?

Well, I can see a use of being able to use it for bash as well as zsh, so will
port across the most basic of the plugins I use, or find equivalent ones, and
then get App-Antigen to work properly with that. Honestly, im fairly sure this
will be quite easy, due to how I've written it, but MVP first (Minimum Viable
Product).

The other modifications I can see being useful, is for it to work from other
git repositories, as well as from tarballs - including ones which are on your
local machine, for those of you who actually develop plugins for your shell!

# So what else have you been doing?

Well, this week I have been working quite hard on a new product which we are
releasing at work - see the recent blog post on it on [Mark's
blog][mdk-shadownms]. This has been a long run of design and development by
myself and the rest of the team, and hopefully will be useful to a lot of
people! I will be following up the release with a blog post of my own on the
[Shadowcat Site][shadow-cat-site] at some point, so watch that space!

Apart from that, there hasnt been much, apart from my usual gaming nights, and hoping to go out cycling more. After getting hold of a Brompton through the Cycle Scheme I have been cycling every day to work, and have been planning on going on a long ride at some point with just my camera.
