# I'm Back!

And wow I have managed to fail massively at this blogging routine. However, I'm
back in the driving seat, as it were, and have developed a few new features -
namely my new [Projects pages!](/projects).

This is hopefully going to evolve a bit more over the coming weeks, and I will
be eventually blogging about the various helper scripts I wrote to help make it
a bit easier to write posts - if you want to have a look at them, head on over
to them [on Github](https://github.com/TBSliver/TBSliver-Me/tree/master/bin),
they are the generate-blog and project-update scripts.

Anyway, this is only a quick update as its actually 4 in the morning, and I
should really go to bed. Hopefully I will get round to writing more about this
tomorrow/today (depending on how you look at it)...
