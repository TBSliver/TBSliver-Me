# Here we go again..

So here I am again, typing another blog post. Except this time, im writing it
in markdown, and it will then be statically generated to HTML, using some
exceedingly clever perl which I have been adding things to.

The main program is called App-SCS, and was created by Matt Trout (mst). This
app is only a very basic website creator, and although very powerful, has not
many features to start with. So I have started working on a Blogging platform
for it! The code can be found in my Github, at [App-SCS-Blog][1]. An example
  app with the Blog working in it (with instructions on how to install it!) is
  at [App-SCS-Example][2]

Infact, for ultimate insanity, the raw markdown, html, and js for this site can
also be found in my Github, at [TBSliver-Me][3]
